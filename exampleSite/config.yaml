          At Certified Employment Group, I spearheaded the revitalization of web interfaces, employing HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to significantly improve user experience. My expertise in utilizing Flutter enabled a seamless, responsive design across various devices, enhancing accessibility and consistency. By developing Python-based server-side applications, I introduced advanced algorithms for data caching and asynchronous processing, which notably reduced API response times and optimized database query efficiency. Implementing a comprehensive Selenium testing framework, I achieved a remarkable 96% pass rate on automated tests, substantially minimizing production bugs and bolstering the web application's reliability. My efforts not only refined the technical landscape but also fostered a more engaging and dependable user environment.

          At DBRIEF.AI in Berkeley, CA, as the Lead App Developer, I successfully led the development of their mobile application from scratch, utilizing Dart and Flutter. My role encompassed designing the user interface with Figma, adhering to UX design best practices and integrating user feedback to enhance overall usability and satisfaction. I was instrumental in architecting the backend API synchronization, facilitating dynamic content updates aligned with the latest news, which contributed to a significant 15% growth in daily active users. I harnessed Firebase's real-time database capabilities for dynamic data updates, thus enhancing the app's responsiveness and ensuring timely information delivery to users. My innovation included developing a 'Tinder-style' swiping feature, leading to a 20% increase in user engagement time. Furthermore, I guided and mentored a team of four through agile development cycles, ensuring cross-functional collaboration and timely application delivery.

        content: Ants vs Bees is my favorite project, born out of my love for video games and my childhood dream to become a video game developer, which inspired me to major in Computer Science. This project involved creating a game similar to Plants vs Zombies, where I used Object-Oriented Programming to design different classes of ants and bees, each with unique abilities. I developed the game using Python and Tkinter for the GUI, implementing various abstract data structures to manage the game's state and logic.

Inspired by my own journey as a recent graduate facing the challenges of job hunting, this project leverages advanced AI technologies to enhance resume relevance and impact. Utilizing word2vec for word embeddings and Convex's vector search, the application compares job postings with a comprehensive list of projects and experiences, selecting the five most pertinent ones. Additionally, an LLM like OpenAI's GPT fine-tunes project descriptions to align perfectly with job requirements. Developed with a tech stack including Python, OpenAI, Gradio, Convex, LLM, word2vec, and GitHub.

      - title: Cryptok
        content: Cryptok is a Web3 social media platform developed to foster a more transparent and equitable environment for content distribution, particularly for digital creators and freelancers. As computer science students from Berkeley, we were motivated to dive into the world of Web3 by building our own project. Traditional Web2 platforms like YouTube have centralized control over content distribution, allowing them to prioritize or demote content based on their preferences. Cryptok disrupts this model by utilizing blockchain technology to ensure that user engagement directly influences content visibility through tokenized interactions. Each interaction, such as likes or comments, is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain via smart contracts, which store details like user ID, type of interaction, and timestamp, and calculate the number of tokens earned. Users can cash out tokens at any time, with token values fluctuating based on overall engagement.
