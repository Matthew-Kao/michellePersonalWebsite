          At PT Kalbe Farma Tbk, I conducted data-driven analysis by developing a demand/supply forecasting model that helped reduce overstock and understock issues while improving logistic routing efficiency. I automated processes using Python scripts and led projects in areas such as customer targeting and marketing optimization. Additionally, I conducted genetic data analysis, working with ancestry-informative SNPs and Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression. I also published an abstract on Ancestry-Adjusted Polygenic Risk Scores for predicting obesity risk, presented at the Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference 2024.

      - title: Ancestry-Adjusted Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)
        content: In this project, a method was developed to adjust Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for obesity based on individual ancestry, thereby improving risk prediction accuracy across diverse populations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to differentiate ancestries using genomic data from the 1000 Genomes Project, uncovering the variance in risk distribution across ethnic groups. A linear regression model was designed to adjust PRS, reducing bias for each ancestry group. This adjustment led to more precise obesity risk classification, which was validated through adjusted PRS distributions, ensuring more equitable health assessments across populations.

        content: This project involved conducting a detailed demographic analysis of Nutrigenme users across Indonesia, with a particular focus on BMI distribution and demographic characteristics in urban areas like Jakarta. Through geographic mapping and demographic modeling, BMI trends were visualized across the country, identifying patterns in population density and gender distribution. The analysis offered insights into BMI variations within Jakarta’s districts, enabling targeted health interventions and providing valuable data for product development tailored to the health and wellness needs of the population.

        content: In this project, as a lead mentor for a team of 8, the goal was to develop Fish.io, a multiplayer game focused on ocean and biodiversity conservation, utilizing C++, Unity Engine, and Blender for 3D modeling. Key contributions included implementing back-end server logic for real-time multiplayer interactions, integrating character models and game features into the backend, and developing core game features such as scoring and dynamic content updates. The result was a scalable and engaging game that showcased effective project management and technical execution during the final semester showcase.
